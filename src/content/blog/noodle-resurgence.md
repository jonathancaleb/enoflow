## The Enoflow Story

Enoflow is a project that has been in the works for a long time now. It has gone through many ups and downs, but it has always been a project that I have been passionate about. I have always believed in the idea behind Enoflow and I have always wanted to see it come to life.

### Early Beginnings

Enoflow as a concept was born during my day to day activities. I had noticed myself using multiple apps just to try and stay on track with my tasks. I was using [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for my calendar, [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for my todos, [Notion](https://notion.so) for note taking.

It was all just a bit much, there is no way I needed all of that to manage my tasks, and why is there no singular app that can do everything a person needs to stay on track with their tasks? Like a GitHub but for students.

### The First Attempt

From last year, I knew I wanted to work on a productivity app and try to make it happen. I teamed up with a friend of mine, and we started working on it. I would handle the development of the app and he would handle the design side of things.

### The First Failure

Despite the enthusiasm and the vision I had for the project, I found myself caught in a cycle of tutorial hell, constantly learning but struggling to apply the knowledge effectively. Technical issues seemed to crop up at every turn, further impeding progress.

As a solo developer with limited resources and knowledge, the reality of the situation was a bitter pill to swallow. Despite the passion and the countless hours poured into this project, Enoflow never saw the light of day. It was a tough lesson in the realities of software development, but one that I knew was necessary for both my personal growth and the integrity of the project.

## The Resurrection

After a brief period of absence, lasting for 6 months, I am happy to announce that the project is back in the works. I have taken the time to reflect on what went wrong the first time around and I have learned so much from that experience.

### The Future of Enoflow

I am excited to see where this new journey with Enoflow will take me. I have learned so much from the first attempt and I am confident that I will be able to deliver something that I can be proud of this time around.

I will be documenting the progress of Enoflow on this blog, so make sure to check back regularly for updates on the project. I am excited to have you all along for the ride and I can't wait to see where this new journey with Enoflow will take me.
