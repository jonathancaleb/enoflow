![Noodle Preview](https://github.com/noodle-run/noodle/blob/main/public/_static/dark-dashboard-preview.jpg?raw=true)

<p align="center" style="color:dodgerblue;"><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è This is a UI design mockup of what the platform will look like, it is not the current state of the project.</strong></p>

## Purpose

Noodle as an idea came from the struggles that I faced during my university years. I was using multiple apps to try and stay on track with my studies, and I thought to myself, why is there no singular app that can do everything a student needs to stay on track with their studies? Like a GitHub but for students.

## Planned MVP Features

- ‚úçÔ∏è Note Taking
- üìö Flashcards

The flashcards will be generated from the notes that you take, and you will be able to quiz yourself on them.

## Future Features

- üìÖ Calendar
- üìù Task management
- üìä Grade tracking

Feel free to suggest more features by opening an issue, or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ewKmQd8kYm) to discuss it with the community.
